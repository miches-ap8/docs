---

Learn how As1's Unified API allows you to seamlessly communicate with your multi-service ecosystem.    


## What is Unified API?

Unified API is the standardization of different vendor API data models and exposing them to you as 1 single service.

Bring your own solutions, bring your own business rules and let As1 API handle the rest of the hard stuff. 

* Problem keeping up with different vendor API SDKs? Check.  
* At loss maintaining field mappings from one service to another? Check. 
* No coding skills? Check.

## The Big Picture

When used with As1's Automation, Orchestration and AI engines, you don't need serious coding skills to be on top of your processes. 

Simply, let As1 know what data you need, what synchonization flow you prefer, and everything just works.
